| Problem | Solution/Not Addressed | How We See This Today |
|---------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Reliability Across Multiple Networks: How do you ensure data gets through when it has to cross several different networks? | To ensure data gets through several networks, the paper proposes multiple ways to keep track of the traveling data. For example, having the receiver send back an acknowledgement to show data has been received. They also add the functionality of fragmentation to support multiple networks. Lastly, we also mark the ends of segments and messages to ensure the entire message is received. | When I send messages to family members over seas,  I can be sure that they have received the message. Sometimes when I send multiple messages, on my end, it looks like they might have sent out of order but based on responses I can tell the message was received correctly. |
| Addressing Across Networks: How do you create addresses that work across different network types? | The idea of addresses was to have a uniform internetwork address that each gateway and TCP could understand. They chose a network ID of 8 bits and using different parts of the address to mark a destination network and gateway. | By doing any type of work that utilizes the internet, I can see that my data is being transmitted successfully. Whether it is streaming content, sending messages, or online shopping, I am interacting without issue.  |
| Accounting/Billing: How do you handle charging when data crosses networks owned by different organizations? | The paper assumes that each network charges a fixed rate per packet transmitted and that an increase in a network’s packet size does not result in an additional cost, making the cost to the user almost constant. | I think that we see the opposite today. Where different companies make users pay more for more reliable, fast, and large internet usage. We can see this in applications like streaming services or cloud storage. | 
|Routing Between Networks: How does data find its way from Network A through Network B to reach Network C? | The paper traces the flow of data in Figure 2. To send data from process X to process Y, it enters and traverses network A. At the gateway the packet is then reformatted to be able to traverse network B. This is repeated until the destination is reached. | When I using shopping services originating in other countries like Korea, I can still interact with the website like normal. Despite the physical distance, the data and connection is still reaching its destination. |
| Privacy/Encryption: How do you prevent others from reading your data as it crosses multiple networks? | The paper did not talk about ensuring privacy and security between the user and product. | As users we typically trust the website or platform that our data is protected. Especially with messaging systems, we cannot be sure that the inbetween networks are not reading out data. | 
| Network Performance at Scale: What happens when millions of people try to use the internet simultaneously? | The paper does not address how to handle large traffic. While they had ideas on how to handle the growth of the internet, they did not address the management of millions of users. | With so many people staying connected to the internet constantly, we often see latency and delays. |
